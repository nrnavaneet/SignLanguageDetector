# SignLanguageDetector
The Sign Language Detector project utilizes the power of OpenCV and Python to recognize and interpret sign language gestures captured through a webcam. Leveraging computer vision techniques, the system detects hand movements and translates them into corresponding signs, enabling communication for individuals with hearing impairments.
